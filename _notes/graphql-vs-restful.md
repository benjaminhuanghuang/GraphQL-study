# GraphQL vs Restful API

- Fetch data from multiple source
- Minimize the number of calls to the server
- Get just the data you need for a query
- GraphQl prevents under-fetching and over-fetching

## REST Drawbacks

- Overfetching (API returns more data than the client actually needs.)
- Underfetching (API doesn’t return enough data in a single request)
