## Why Use GraphQL?

- Type inspection
- Query multiple databases from one GraphQL server
- Flexibility of the queries

## Not Always Ideal

- More code to set up
- Small applications; stick to REST
- Evaluate your scaling plans
- Start small with REST and grow with GraphQL

## Setup

```sh
npm i mongoose graphql@15 express-graphql express
```
